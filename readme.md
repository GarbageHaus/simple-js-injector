## Simple JS Injector

This addon creates a small popup that lets you paste some JS code and inject it into the page you are currently seeing. It also allows for Importing and Exporting JSON files so that customizations can be shared within your organization or group without requiring it to be public.

This is a clone of the respository from [joeperpetua](https://github.com/joeperpetua/simple-js-injector) with the express purpose of adding the import/export functionality. This respository is seperate to allow for additional changes.

This, _originally_ is an adaptation to Firefox version of the Chrome extension "JS injector" from  [Daniel Han](https://github.com/hex0cter/js-injector). It is [only available in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-injector/ejnccfcackblkelbafbolcpjfpcmbplg) it has been updated by [joeperpetua] to work in Firefox.

You can check out the original GitHub page for Chrome [here](https://github.com/hex0cter)
